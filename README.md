Overview

Imagine being able to predict diabetes with just a few diagnostic measurements. This project is all about making that a reality. We’re using data from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, specifically focusing on female patients of Pima Indian heritage who are 21 years or older. Our goal? To accurately determine whether a patient has diabetes.

Dataset Source

Our data comes straight from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Content

The dataset includes several medical predictor variables along with one target variable called Outcome. Here’s a breakdown:

Pregnancies: Number of times the patient has been pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Indicates if the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0)

Project Structure

Files

diabetes.csv: This file contains all the medical records and outcomes.
Diabetes.ipynb: Our Jupyter notebook where all the magic happens. It includes code for loading data, exploring it, preprocessing, building models, and evaluating them.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA section of our notebook, we:

Visualize distributions and relationships between variables.

Identify any missing values and outliers.
Summarize key statistics for each feature.

Data Preprocessing


To prepare our data, we:
Handle missing values
Scale features appropriately.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Building
We try out several machine learning models to see which one works best:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Evaluation
To evaluate our models, we use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We also look at confusion matrices and ROC curves to get a better picture of each model’s performance.

Conclusion


This project showcases how different machine learning models can be used to predict diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. Through thorough analysis and model evaluation, we pinpoint the most effective model for our task.

Future Work
For future enhancements, we could:

Fine-tune more models' hyperparameters.
Explore more advanced models, like neural networks.
A big thanks to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases for providing the dataset that made this project possible.
